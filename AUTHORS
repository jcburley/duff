Camilla Berglund <elmindreda@users.sourceforge.net> wrote the first
version of duff, and is currently the main author.

James Craig Burley <james@jcb-sc.com> modified version 0.4 of duff
to create version 0.5.

Duff contains and uses the SHA1 message digest code from the sha-asaddi
package, which was written by Allan Saddi <allan@saddi.com>.  See the
files `sha1.c' or `sha1.h' for copyright and license details.

Ideas, suggestions, spelling corrections and bug fixes have been
contributed by various people, and they are noted in the appropriate
entries of the `ChangeLog' file.

The `join-duplicates.sh' script was originally written by a person
who so far is only known to me as "Snow".
