duff - Duplicate file finder
============================

0. Introduction
===============

Duff is a command-line utility for identifying duplicates in a given set of
files.  It attempts to be usably fast, and uses SHA1 checksums as a part of
the comparisons.

The project website is here:

  http://duff.sourceforge.net/

Duff resides in public CVS on cvs.sourceforge.net.  The CVSROOT for anonymous,
read-only access is:

  :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/duff

The CVS module for duff 0.x is `duff'.

The version numbering scheme for duff is as follows:

 * The first number is the major version.  This will be updated upon what the
   author considers a round of feature completion.  The only feature currently
   missing for the next major release is i18n.

 * The second number is the minor version number.  This is updated for releases
   that include minor new features, or features that do not change the
   functionality of the program.

 * The third number, if present, is the bugfix release number.  This indicates
   a release which only fixes bugs present in a previous major or minor release.

3. Building Duff
================

If you got this source tree from a CVS repository, you will need to bootstrap
the build environment using `bootstrap.sh'.  Note that this script requires
autoconf and automake to run.

If (or once) you have a `configure' script, go ahead and run it.  No additional
magic should be required.  If it is, then that's a bug and should be reported.

This release of duff has been successfully built on the following systems:

  Arch Linux x86
  Darwin 7.9.0 powerpc
  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Sarge alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  NetBSD 1.6.1 sparc
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64
  Ubuntu Breezy x86

Earlier releases have been successfully built on the following systems:

  Arch Linux x86
  Darwin 7.9.0 powerpc
  Debian Etch powerpc
  Debian Sarge alpha
  FreeBSD 4.11 x86
  FreeBSD 5.4 x86
  SunOS 5.9 sparc64

The tools used were gcc and GNU or BSD make.  However, it should build on most
Unix systems without modifications.


4. Installing Duff
==================

See the file `INSTALL'.


5. Using Duff
=============

See the accompanying manpage duff(1).

To read the manpage before installation, use the following command:

  groff -mdoc -Tascii duff.1 | less -R

On Linux systems, however, the following command may suffice:

  man -l duff.1

8. Disambiguation
=================

This is duff, the Unix command-line utility, and not DUFF, the Windows program.
If you wish to find duplicate files on Windows, use DUFF.


9. Release history
===================

Version 0.1 was named `duplicate', and was never released anywhere.

Version 0.2 was the first release named duff.  It lacked a real checksumming
algorithm, and was thus only released to a few individuals, during the first
half of 2005.

Version 0.3 was the first official release, on November 22, 2005, after a
prolonged search for a suitably licensed implementation of SHA1.

Version 0.3.1 was a bugfix release, on November 27, 2005, adding a single
feature (-z), which just happened to get included.

Version 0.4 was the second feature release, on January 13, 2006, adding a
number of missing and/or requested features as well as bug fixes.  It was the
first release to be considered stable and safe enough for everyday use.

Version 0.5 improves the algorithm that searches for duplicates by
sorting the list of entries.  The changes to this version were contributed
by James Craig Burley <james@jcb-sc.com>.
